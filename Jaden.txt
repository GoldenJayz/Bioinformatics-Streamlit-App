Go to model.ipynb file. You don't need to know everything, just the 2nd block of code. 

In the second block, go to the line where it says: 

target = new_client.target
target_query = target.search('acetylcholinesterase')

refer to this part as X


and take note of the section of code in the second block:

selected_target = targets.target_chembl_id[0]

refer to this part as Y


This overall part of the program goes into a database and collects data, in X, 'acetylcholinesterase' was the search term (so it can be replaced etc).

In Y, the '[0]' part is just the index, this part you don't really need to understand. 

Just both 'acetylcholinesterase' and the int in '[0]', I am trying to make it 'filled in' by user input on the streamlit front-end. 

However the process should go, X input, Y input, then searches on the database. However when I tried doing this on streamlit it went, X input, runs the code and searches, missing Y input error, ya know?

If you can fix this issue thanks.
