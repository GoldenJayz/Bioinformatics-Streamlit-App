### BIOINFORMATICS RM PROJECTS Notes:

- research RNA DNA CORNA SEQUENCES< THIS WORK FOR OTHER VIRUSES?
- work and finish target protein analysis / this part is the Streamlit app (does all the parts work under one file, or two files? (also access github through google colab))
- work on data / conc. (Do I have enough pictures)
- work on journal 
- work on video

Thu: Work on Data Essay (try to do as much as you can)
Fri: Work on Data Essay (try to finish)
Sat: Work on finishing the application (Working on all parts work together in software)
Sun: Work on finishing the application (Working on streamlit app, connecting all)
Mon: Finish the application (Finish streamlit app, connecting all)
Tue: Finish Data Essay (work on application if needed)
Wed: Finish Data Essay (start working on RNA DNA if needed)
Thu: Work on RNA DNA 
Fri: Work on RNA DNA
Sat: Work on journal / work on RNA DNA 
Sun: Work on presentation 
Mon: Done

PART 1:
IC5O information:
- IC50 is the potency of the drug, in part 1, the standard_value part, the lower the number the more potency the drug becomes. Higher number, the worse the potency becomes. 
- (Standerd value should be as lower as possible)
- The inhibitory concentration at 50%, would have a low concentration 
--> (In order to licit 50% of the inibitors of a target protein you would need a lower concentration of the drug)
--> The higher the concentration is required, you require more of the drug in order to perform the same
- The bioactivity data is in the IC50 unit, compounds with 1000 nM (standerd_value) are active, etc, etc. Three classes: Inactive, active, intermediate
-->Active ingredient is the ingredient in a pharmaceutical drug that is bioloically active. 

PART 2:
Lipinski Descriptors:
- Christopher Lipinski, a scientist atPifzer, came up with a set of rule-of-thumb for evaluating the druglikeness of compounds.
- Druglikenessis based on Absorption, Ditribution, Metabolism, Excretion (Also known as the pharmacokinetic profile)
--> Lipinsky analyzed all orally active FDA-approved drugs in the formulation of what is to be known as the Rule of Five or Lipinski's Rule
Rules:
- Molecular weight < 500 Dalton 
- Octanol-water partition coefficient (LogP) < 5
- Hydrogen bond donors < 5
- Hydrogen bond acceptors < 10


#### THE DATA PRESENTED:

INTRO (explain what everything this)

Part 1: 
- IC5O information, show table (Show all Three)
--> Explain what IC50 is, standerd_value, why this is important

Part 2:
- Exploratory data on active, inactive and intermediate data
--> Explain what these terms mean (SHOW ALL THREE)

Part 4:
- Model desc. (SHOW ONE)

Part 5:
- Mutiple model comparisions / show table information as well 
- (SHOW ALL THREE)

Part 6:
- This part is unknown if I will do it
- RNA 3D model 
- Show canconical smiles
- Create streamlit app to present the data better (you can work on this) 
--> Pictures of streamlit app


### NOTES:
- Change the target proten to be different and test them out, cornavirus, etc (other target protiens, look at the chembl website search for target protien)
