### BIOINFORMATICS RM PROJECTS Notes:

- Fri: Finish the software part, to makework with target protiens other than *ace*. Change target protien manually within code.
- Sat: Work on conculsion, honest to god just bullshit the fuck outta this one
- Sun: Work on finishing the application (Working on streamlit app, connecting all)
- Mon: Finish the application (Finish streamlit app, connecting all)
- Tue: Finish Data Essay (work on application if needed)
- Wed: Finish Data Essay (start working on RNA DNA if needed)
- Thu: Work on RNA DNA 
- Fri: Work on RNA DNA
- Sat: Work on journal / work on RNA DNA 
- Sun: Work on presentation 
- Mon: Done

PART 1:
IC5O information:
- IC50 is the potency of the drug, in part 1, the standard_value part, the lower the number the more potency the drug becomes. Higher number, the worse the potency becomes. 
- (Standerd value should be as lower as possible)
- The inhibitory concentration at 50%, would have a low concentration 
--> (In order to licit 50% of the inibitors of a target protein you would need a lower concentration of the drug)
--> The higher the concentration is required, you require more of the drug in order to perform the same
- The bioactivity data is in the IC50 unit, compounds with 1000 nM (standerd_value) are active, etc, etc. Three classes: Inactive, active, intermediate
-->Active ingredient is the ingredient in a pharmaceutical drug that is bioloically active. 

PART 2:
Lipinski Descriptors:
- Christopher Lipinski, a scientist atPifzer, came up with a set of rule-of-thumb for evaluating the druglikeness of compounds.
- Druglikenessis based on Absorption, Ditribution, Metabolism, Excretion (Also known as the pharmacokinetic profile)
--> Lipinsky analyzed all orally active FDA-approved drugs in the formulation of what is to be known as the Rule of Five or Lipinski's Rule
Rules:
- Molecular weight < 500 Dalton 
- Octanol-water partition coefficient (LogP) < 5
- Hydrogen bond donors < 5
- Hydrogen bond acceptors < 10

### NOTES:
- Change the target proten to be different and test them out, cornavirus, etc (other target protiens, look at the chembl website search for target protien)
- For data anaylsis paper, you need images (both cor and hep) of the model predictions. Prediction vs Experimental pIC50 values.
